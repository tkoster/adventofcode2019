# Advent of Code 2019 in Haskell

This repository contains my solutions to Advent of Code 2019.

I am using a rough and ready style of Haskell: I am not too worried about partial functions or performance/laziness here. Almost anything goes as long as it works well with GHCi.

To avoid too much iteration in GHCi though, most solutions contain a few tests here and there directly in the module that I used to check my work as I go.
